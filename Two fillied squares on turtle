#The draw_square() function is a helper function that takes a turtle object, a size, and a color, and uses the turtle to draw a square with the given size and color.
def draw_square(t, size, color):
    t.color(color)
    t.begin_fill()
    for sides in range(4):
        t.forward(size)
        t.right(90)
    t.end_fill()
#The square_line() function takes a turtle object, a number of squares to draw, and a list of colors to alternate between. It then calls draw_square() repeatedly to draw the squares in the specified colors, using the modulo operator to cycle through the colors.
def square_line(turtle, num_squares, colors):

    for i in range(num_squares):
        draw_square(turtle, size, colors[i % len(colors)])
        turtle.penup()

        turtle.pendown()
#The colors list contains the colors to use for the alternating squares.

#The turtle object t is created with turtle.Turtle(), and its speed is set to 5 with t.speed(5)
t = turtle.Turtle()

#Finally, square_line() is called with t, 2, and colors as arguments, so it draws a line of 2 squares in blue and red colors.
