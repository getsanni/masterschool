--Barcelona is considered one of the strongest teams in Spain's soccer league.

--In this exercise, you will be creating a list of matches in the 2011â€“2012 season where Barcelona was the home team. You will do this using a CASE statement that compares the values of two columns to create a new group -- wins, losses, and ties.

--In 3 steps, you will build a query that identifies a match's winner, identifies the identity of the opponent, and finally filters for Barcelona as the home team. Completing a query in this order will allow you to watch your results take shape with each new piece of information.

--The matches_spain table currently contains Barcelona's matches from the 2011/2012 season, and has two key columns, hometeam_id and awayteam_id, that can be joined with the teams_spain table. However, you can only join teams_spain to one column at a time.  

SELECT 
	-- Select the date of the match
	date,
	-- Identify home wins, losses, or ties
	CASE WHEN home_goal > away_goal THEN 'Home win!'
        WHEN home_goal < away_goal THEN'Home loss :(' 
        ELSE 'Tie' END AS outcome
FROM matches_spain;

SELECT 
	m.date,
	t.team_long_name AS opponent,
    -- Complete the CASE statement with an alias
	CASE WHEN m.home_goal > away_goal THEN 'Barcelona win!'
        WHEN  m.home_goal < away_goal THEN 'Barcelona loss :(' 
        ELSE 'Tie' END AS outcome 
FROM matches_spain AS m
LEFT JOIN teams_spain AS t 
ON m.awayteam_id = t.team_api_id
-- Filter for Barcelona as the home team
WHERE m.hometeam_id = 8634; 

-- Select matches where Barcelona was the away team
SELECT  
	m.date,
	t.team_long_name AS opponent,
	CASE WHEN m.home_goal < m.away_goal THEN 'Barcelona win!'
        WHEN m.home_goal > m.away_goal THEN 'Barcelona loss :(' 
        ELSE 'Tie' END AS outcome
FROM matches_spain AS m
-- Join teams_spain to matches_spain
LEFT JOIN teams_spain AS t 
ON m.hometeam_id = t.team_api_id
WHERE m.awayteam_id = 8634;
